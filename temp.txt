Domino Goes to the Beach  By W. R. Davis  A picture book for children and anyone who loves their pet.  Copyright 2012  This story is dedicated to Domino, who has provided us with years of companionship and love.  Domino is a Boston Terrier.  She likes to play with her toys and enjoys her family. Domino sat one Tuesday, looking so sad.  She wanted something exciting to do, but it was too cold outside.  We asked Domino if she would like to go to the beach to visit Alex. She was so excited!  Alex was Domino's human brother who moved far away to a beautiful town on the coast of New Jersey.  We traveled many hours in the car. Domino was very good and sat patiently in her seat. We made frequent stops at doggie friendly areas.  On the way to the hotel, we stopped and surprised Alex. He had no idea that Domino was coming to visit him.  When we arrived at the hotel, Domino was a little nervous, but happy to be out of the car so she could stretch her legs.  The sand was soft on Domino's paws and there were so many new scents.  The waves came up and got her feet wet. She didn't like that very much and made certain to not get too close the the ocean.  Domino saw lots of things that she had never seen before. The gulls were quite odd to Domino. The noise they made sounded like laughter.  What funny birds. Nothing like the small birds at home.  Afterward, Domino needed a nap as she was so tired from her busy day.  The next day Domino went sight-seeing at a nearby town. It was a nice walk through the streets lined with quaint shops.  Domino went on the boardwalk. Dogs usually aren't allowed on the boardwalk, but since it was the off-season there were only a few people so no one minded that she was there. She stopped so some little girls could visit with her.  Domino had a few bites of peanut butter frozen custard, yum!!!  Domino saw some huge concrete beach balls. They wouldn't roll or bounce so they weren't too much fun for dogs to play with.   We went metal detecting on the beach. I bet domino hoped that we would findsome dog bones buried in the sand, but we only found a few old metal bottle caps. We threw them in the trash because we want to make sure the beaches are clean and free of trash that can cut our feet or paws.  She took a nap with Alex. I bet Domino had sweet dreams of the birds laughing as the cool waves covered her paws or the sweet taste of frozen custard or how nice it was to visit with him.  We left for the long ride back home with fond memories of all of the fun adventures that we shared.   We look forward for another vacation adventure with our furry family member, Domino. Good bye, Jersey Shore. We hope to come back soon! Woof, woof!  Here are some tips if you want to take your pet on vacation:  Make reservations at a pet friendly hotel a head of time. Sometimes there are special rules and extra charges for pets. Never leave your pet in a car alone where they might become over heated or afraid. It is your responsibility to clean up after your pet. Make sure that you have everything that you need to make your pet feel at home while traveling. Make frequent stops so your dog can stretch. Have water that your pet can sip on. Have your pet vaccinations and license up to date and available. Choose a location where your pet won't spending the whole trip in the hotel room. That won't be a fun vacation for them at all. Keep your pet on a leash to avoid accidents or confrontations with people that may not care for animals. Talk to your veterinarian before your trip. Look on the internet for ideas on things to do and local regulations for pets.

1  On the way home from school, we picked some beautiful yellow dandelions.  2  I made sure to put them in water right away, so that they wouldn’t wilt too quickly.  3  They looked beautiful on our table during lunchtime.  4  But, they looked a little wilted at dinnertime.  5  Then, when bedtime came along: “Oh no! My flowers are dead! What can I do?”  6  I guess that kind of flower doesn’t last very long.  7  The next morning at breakfast, to my surprise: “The flowers are alive again!”  8  I guess they weren’t dead after all, but were only sad or sleeping. Ha! Ha!  9  That night, I felt upset because I didn’t have time to play before bed.  10  “Oh no!” said Mom. “It looks like my little flower is fading.”  11  “Is she talking about me? Am I like a flower too?”  12  It was sad to see the flowers wilt. Do I look like that when I get upset?  13  Think, think, think! Oh, I get it now.  14  When I put a smile on my face, I look like a cheery, lively flower!  15  But when I am grumpy, I start to look droopy and sad, just like a wilting dandelion.  16  I want to keep my smile going forever and ever.

I line up all my  pencils  to spell out the word “GOD”.  I use my  p en c i l  to tell others about God’s love.  With my  pencil  I make Christmas cards to remind others that it’s Jesus’ birthday.  I can use my  p en c i l s  to make finger puppets and tell a Bible story.  Can you think of   more things to do  with a  pencil ?

1  I love going out and seeing new places.  2  “Thanks for taking me along, Dad. This is great fun!”  3  “Oh look!” says Dad, “There is my friend, Greg.”  4  After Dad and Greg shook hands, then it was my turn.  5  But I’m very shy, and don’t feel like shaking hands or saying “Hello.”  6  “If you don’t want to shake hands, can I shake your foot?” Greg asked me.  7  That’s funny. Of course, I don’t want someone to shake my foot.  8  “Or, can I pinch your nose?” asked Greg.  9  Think, Think, Think. What should I do?  10  Hmm, I’d better shake his hand before he asks to squeeze my cheeks, I thought.  11  “Hi Greg, it’s nice to meet you!” I said, as I shook his hand.  12  It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  13  On the way home, Dad said, “Thanks for greeting my friend. I’m sure he was happy about that.”  14  I felt happier as well. It’s important for me to treat others with kindness even when I feel shy.  15  The next day: Ding! Dong! Ding! Dong! “Hello Mrs. White! It’s nice to meet you”.  Please help spread the word by introducing your friends to our products.
